Branches are used for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our main (production) branch. When a change is ready, we merge our branch into main.
Saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made, so other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
